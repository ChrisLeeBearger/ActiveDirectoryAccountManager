LONG DESCRIPTION
    Root allows you to work with the Stack Exchange API through PowerShell functions


DETAILED DESCRIPTION
    This is a rudimentary module that allows querying for arbitrary Stack Exchange API objects. It also implements searching or retrieving questions, and retrieving answers.

    Objects returned from SEQuestion and SEAnswer functions use formatting that hides properties from the default view. You can explore these objects like any other PowerShell object.

    Objects returned from SEQuestion have an artificial SESite property added, allowing you to pipe SEQuestion output to Get-SEAnswer.
